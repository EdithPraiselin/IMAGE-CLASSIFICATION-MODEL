# BUILD-A-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL-NETWORK-CNN-FOR-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-USING-TENSORFLOW-OR-PYTORCH

**COMPANY**: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

**NAME**: EDITH PRAISELIN P

**INTERN ID**: CT12WJQU

**DOMAIN**: MACHINE LEARNING

**BATCH DURATION**: JANUARY 5th, 2025 to APRIL 5th, 2025

**MENTOR NAME**: NEELA SANTHOSH

**DESCRIPTION**: The task involves selecting and preprocessing a suitable dataset, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to enhance model robustness. A well-structured CNN architecture should be designed, incorporating multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification. The model should be trained using an appropriate optimizer such as Adam. The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, validation accuracy and loss, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of its classification ability. Training and validation loss curves should be visualized to monitor progress.
